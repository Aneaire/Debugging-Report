# GAPS Analysis

## Server Setup Concerns
The issues may also be linked to the current server configuration. For detailed analysis, refer to the [Debugging Report in README.md](README.md), which discusses server-side setup challenges, including outdated servers and improper SGTM configurations.

## Tag Management Issues
Current GTM tags lack clear naming and purpose, making it difficult to understand their functions. A thorough audit is needed to:
- Review all tags and their triggers.
- Rename tags descriptively based on their actual roles.
- Eliminate redundant or unnecessary tags to improve clarity and performance.

## Documentation Needs
To ensure infrastructure is well-documented:
- Create comprehensive documentation for all tags, triggers, and configurations.
- Document server setups, API integrations, and data flows.
- Maintain an updated knowledge base for future maintenance and troubleshooting.

## Stakeholder Concerns
Key issues raised include:
- **No Visibility on Amazon and eBay Orders in GA4**: External orders are not captured, leading to incomplete data.
- **Inconsistent Attribution Data Reduces Trust**: Unreliable data undermines confidence in analytics.
- **Data Lag and Misallocated Orders Make Reports Unreliable**: Delays and errors distort performance insights.
- **Dependence on GTM Without Clarity on Essential Tags**: Lack of understanding hinders optimization and troubleshooting.

Addressing these gaps will enhance data accuracy, system reliability, and overall tracking infrastructure.
