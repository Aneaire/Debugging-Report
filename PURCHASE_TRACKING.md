# Purchase Tracking Analysis

## Current Status
Duplicate purchase events from Fueld app and GTM tags have been resolved. Purchase events now flow correctly to GA4.

## Identified Issues
- Amazon and eBay orders (added via API) are missing.
- Some orders missing due to reporting lag.
- Some orders appear on the wrong day, skewing daily reporting.

## Root Cause Analysis
Issues likely arise from how purchase data is sent and how payloads are handled. Suspect problems in:
- **Data Transmission**: API integrations for external orders may not trigger standard purchase events.
- **Payload Handling**: Inconsistent data structures, timestamp errors, or processing delays could cause missing or misattributed events.

Note: Current access is read-only, limiting our ability to inspect API implementations and identify exact issues. Review GTM/GA4 configs, including triggers, tags, API integrations, and payload testing.

## Recommendations
1. **Audit Current Implementation**: Perform a detailed code review of GTM tags, triggers, and GA4 event configurations to identify discrepancies in data handling.
2. **Enhance API Capture**: Implement or modify API webhooks to ensure Amazon and eBay orders trigger appropriate GA4 events.
3. **Improve Timestamp Accuracy**: Standardize timestamp handling to reflect actual order dates accurately.
4. **Implement Monitoring**: Add logging and alerts for purchase events to detect and address lags or missing data in real-time.
5. **Testing and Validation**: Conduct comprehensive testing across all order sources to validate data integrity before deployment.

Addressing these issues will ensure accurate and reliable purchase tracking in GA4.
